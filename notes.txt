	localStorage.setitem uses a keyWord ('replacements'), and a keyValue(JSON.stringify(blahblahblah));
	localStorage.getItem gets the value of the keyWord used by localStorage.setItem ('replacements');
	
	Questions:{ for (pOS.innerText = something)
		do we need to return something for donePOS();? Thinking that we need to return the string of the new word. 

		how do we get the story to the next page. Through local storage. We need to set the localStorage of story to a keyWord and the value of story. (JSON.stringify?).
